# this is a readme for missing_numbers function
this is a function that receives arguments in form of two lists and compares 
the elements of one list to the other to find out which elements are different 
between the two lists. It uses the built in function sorted() to run the main 
portion of the program. it sorts the arrays in ascending order then creates sets. 
it then subtracts the second set from the first in order to determine the elements
in the second list that differ from those in the first. 
the alternative method of achieving the same result is through use of a nested for loop.
it compares one element of the first list to every element of the second list, increments
the index and repeats the procedure all over again. this has been demonstrated in the C++
file.
